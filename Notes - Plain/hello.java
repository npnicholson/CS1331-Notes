	Java Source (name.java) ==> javac name.java ==> Java Byte Code (name.class) ==> Java Interpreter

	Java is Architecure neutral because of the Java Byte Code
		Java SE Development kit (JDK)

	Syntax = Where things go
	Semantics = What things do

	Objects
		Have two parts: States and behaviors
			States are like attributes
			Behaviors are like methods or programs that run

	A Class is a model from which objects are made

	Encapsulation - Each object manages its own data

	Inheritance - Parent child heirchey. Classes come together to form this.
