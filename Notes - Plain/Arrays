Arrays - List of values. Positions (index) are numbered

        Scores:

        0   [73]
        1   [12]
        2   [43] --> System.out.println(scores[2]); // prints "43"

    Arrays are objects in Java
        int[] scores = new int[3];
          |     |              |
          V     V              V
        Type  Name            Size

    Array size is locked in palce from the start. They are also homogeneous
        Cant store ints and strings or booleans together
            
    Java does automatic bounds checking. Any attempt to access outside this bound will result in a runtime exception:
        ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

    Java array's length is help in a constant in the array object (a private constant within the array class)
        The variable is called length
            score.length above would be 3

        To cycle through an array, use:
        for (int i = 0; i < scores.length; i++)
            System.out.println(scores[i]);

    Java allows an alternate way of declaring arrays:
        int scores[]; // Dont do this

        int[] scores; // Do this one

    Initialization of an array

        int [] scores = {0,1,2,3,4} // Will have a length of 5 forever, however the values can change as needed

    Arrays of objects:
        
        String[] words = new String[25];

        Each string in words must be inited as well:
            string[0] = new String("Some Word");


For each loops

    double[] a;
    
    /* code to init a */

    for (double element : a)
        System.out.println(element);

    Also works for objects:

    myObj[] list = new myObj[10];
    for (obj o : list)
        System.out.println(o.getMyMethod);
