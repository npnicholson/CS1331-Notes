While loops:

While (Expression)
{
    // do this
}

// The body might never get run
// Infinite loops are also possible

do while loop:

do {
    //code
} while (expression);

// This will always run the code at least once

For Loops:

    For(Variable = number; var condition; interval){
        // Code
    }

    for(;;){
        // This will run forever
    }

For each loops:
    
    for (obj o : arr){
        // These are the shit
    }

    This loop will cycle through each obj o in the array arr.
