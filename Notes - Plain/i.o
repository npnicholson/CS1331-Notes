System.out.println("This is cool"); // ABV: SOP("This is cool");

Java provides escape sequences, indicated by \ 
    \"  \n  \t  \\

Formatted Output
    System.out.printf("Its %6.2f for %s on %d%n", price, name, day);
        This is a C based method that prints the following:
            "%6.2f" ==> float with min of 6 chars (decimal counts) and 2 spots right of decimal
                Right justified. %-6... would be left justified
            "%s" ==> String
            "%d" ==> int
            "%n" ==> newline

            All together this will print something like this: "Its  34.10 for <name> on <day>"
            (Notice two spaces in front of 34.10 because we allocated 6 spaces above for that entry)
