# Polymorphism

Means having many forms. Allows us to deal with diverse (but related) members of a group in a general way. 

```java
obj.doIt(--); // obj could be of many types
```
We can assign or substitute a member of a subclass for a parent class, but not vise versa. This means that you can substitute *down* a class tree but not down.

Animal ==> bird, dog, etc.

A bird is an animal, but an animal is not necessary a bird.
