# Software Development

Software development can be broken down into four parts:

* **Establish requirements**
    * What must the program do?
        * Functional specs
        * Normally from a client
        * They are fuzzy, ambigous, and contradictory
* **Creating the design**
    * Lay out the pieces
    * Plan the methods and operations that the program runs on
    * Draw a diagram
* **Logical design with a specific implementation**
    * Least creative aspect of these activities
* **Testing**
    * Run on many, varied inputs
    * Debugging matters!

This is **not** a linear process; you will revisit aspects as the program develops.

## Design

One of the aspects to think about is *what are the classes that I need?* In many cases, this comes down to just the nouns of the project description, although there are normally more nouns then classes. 

Finally, *what does each class do?* Largely, these will be verbs in the project description. For example, what are their behaviors and jobs? These form the methods of the class. **Dont worry about having all of these right off the bat**.
